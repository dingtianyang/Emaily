## Adding Credits
To be able to send surveys, you must purchase credits at a cost of $5.00 per 5 credits. To access the purchase screen, you need to click the blue "Add Credits" button in the navigation bar. To "purchase" free credits for testing/usage of the application, you should insert your email address, and insert "4242 4242 4242 4242" as the credit card number, along with any valid expiry date and security number. Once you click "Pay $5.00", you should be redirected to the dashboard, with 5 credits appearing in the navigation bar, within a few seconds. These credits can be used to send 5 surveys (1 per survey).
